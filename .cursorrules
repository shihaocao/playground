Title: C/C++ header include policy

Rules:
- Always use `#pragma once` at the very top of every C/C++ header file.
- Don't worry about supporting the Makefile build system
- Only use clang as the build system, remove support for building via gcc
- If asked to automate something, produce the minimial plumbing example. Do not add example nonsense like this:
    # Function to print colored output
    print_info() {
        echo -e "${BLUE}[INFO]${NC} $1"
    }
